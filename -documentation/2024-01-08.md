## What I Accomplished Yesterday:

## What I Will Do Today:

I got sick and had a fever, so I wasn't able to work over the weekend. Therefore, I have to move back the tasks I brought into Sprint 1 to Sprint 2 again.

- Build basic functionality and UI on the frontend to fetch facilities in a list and ensure that the connection works.#55
- Build basic functionality and UI on the frontend to fetch events in a list.#76

- Insert products and variants into the database and Stripe#47

  I'll take and place this task in a later sprint, and I'll continue with it once the admin panel is in place.

- Plan which tasks I should take on after those I've moved back to Sprint 2.

## Problems:

I still feel sick, and it's stressing me out.
