### Daily Documentation - [2023-12-28]

## What I Accomplished Yesterday:
Finished the user stories and started breaking them down into tasks
## What I Will Do Today:
Continue and finish writing all tasks, format them, and add them to the GitHub project. Start researching OAuth with a classmate.
Create a template for documentation.
## Problems:
Difficult to write all tasks alone without someone to bounce ideas off of, and I get the feeling that I might have forgotten something.
## Research:
Oauth
## Realizations:
And again, it takes much longer to create tasks than I thought and than it has in the past. It might be because I want to be extra careful to ensure it's good for my project, and also because I don't have anyone to bounce ideas off of.

I realized that my idea didn't feel entirely right when I was done with the tasks and went through them.
So I came up with a better, more logical solution. Instead of a booking page with everything in one calendar that can become unclear and too small to see, I have product pages with larger images and more information. Therefore, I had to revise some user stories, rearrange a bit, and modify some tasks.
