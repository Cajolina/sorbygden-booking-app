  Time 23min estimate: 1h

- Set up a server and establish a connection to MongoDB Atlas. https://github.com/Cajolina/sorbygden-booking-app/issues/46

  Time: 14.5min estimate:1h

## What I Will Do Today:

- Create routes: Backend - Create endpoints (get, post, delete) and a REST file or use Postman to check functionality. https://github.com/Cajolina/sorbygden-booking-app/issues/49
- Research OAuth. https://github.com/Cajolina/sorbygden-booking-app/issues/50

## Problems:

Still a bit uncertain about the workflow, OAuth, and unsure how to manage everything on time.

## Research:

OAuth

## Realizations:

Found a better way to log time than manually tracking it. So, the initial tasks were logged by using the phone's timer. I experimented with various time tracking tools such as Toggle, Focus-to-Do, and Clockify. I ultimately chose Clockify, but it took a considerable amount of time to input tasks into each program.
