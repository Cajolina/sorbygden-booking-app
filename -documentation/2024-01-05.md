### Daily Documentation - [2024-01-05]

## What I Accomplished Yesterday:

The guidance session with the teacher was canceled. I took a completely free day to attend and prepare for a interview for Internship Period 2. And plaend to make up for that day over the weekend. But I discussed the conceptual approach, not the implementation details, with an acquaintance regarding the database and Stripe.

## What I Will Do Today:

- Remove the functionality that creates the product in Stripe as well, since I realized that I don't need to have it.
- Transfer more tasks from sprint 2 to sprint 1. Since sprint 1 was started a week earlier, I completed it earlier.
- Plan what to add to my sprint 1 based on what I believe I can accomplish today and tomorrow.

- Ask teacher if Auth0 is fine to use.

## Problems:

It's a bit messy, and I need to rethink my product layout.

## Research:

Add a task for research Auth0

## Realizations:

- I received a suggestion to use Auth0 instead of OAuth, which is supposed to be much easier. I will conduct some research on it later and decide whether to choose it and remove the custom login I have already implemented.
- When the guidance session with the teacher was canceled, I became very stressed because I wanted to ask about some crucial points regarding the project structure in order to proceed. I felt frustrated as I had no one else to turn to, and I couldn't find answers online, possibly because I didn't phrase the question correctly. I took a day off, calmed down a bit, and after talking to an acquaintance, I realized that I don't need to store products in both MongoDB and Stripe since I can send metadata to Stripe. Therefore, I'll set aside the Stripe part for a while until I reach the checkout flow. Today, I feel refreshed, energetic, and ready to tackle the project again.

- My daily documentations take time, but they provide me with valuable reflection and assist in structuring my day. It helps me see the process more clearly. Right now, I feel that I want to continue with them but maybe not count them as project hours and more for my personal development.
