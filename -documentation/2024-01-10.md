### Daily Documentation - [2024-01-10]

## What I Accomplished Yesterday:

I was away for internship interviews in Sundsvall the whole day, but I looked into whether I should use any design system and component library in the project. I think I'm going with Ant Design based on their calendar and simple components.

## What I Will Do Today:

- Guidance session with the teacher
- Create the cart “box” which will display on the event and facility page later.#145
- Create a function to show prices and calculate the total cost.#64
- Include a remove button and buttons to increase or decrease the quantity, with real-time calculation of the total price.#81

## Problems:

I'm still unsure if I've structured my project correctly.

## Research:

## Realizations:
