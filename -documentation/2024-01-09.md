## What I Will Do Today:

Today, I will be away for internship interviews in Sundsvall the whole day, but I will try to accomplish some tasks between the interviews or later tonight.

- Create the cart “box” which will display on the event and facility page later.#145
- Create a function to show prices and calculate the total cost.#64
- Include a remove button and buttons to increase or decrease the quantity, with real-time calculation of the total price.#81
- Check if I should use any design system and component library in the project.#146

## Problems:

I feel uncertain about the backend structure, wondering if it's right to create separate models and endpoints for events and locations or if it's better to have a common one

## Research:

Design system and component library that would suit my project and what I could use from the library.

## Realizations:
