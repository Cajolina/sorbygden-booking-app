  Have tried to solve issues with creating an order in the database, including the right items and proper formatting, but got stuck and haven't been able to resolve it.
- Replan the sprint, attempt to resolve the order issue, and move forward so that I can catch up on everything else

## Problems:

I don't know how to proceed with saving orders; I've spent 3 days on it.
