### Daily Documentation - [2024-01-11]

## What I Accomplished Yesterday:

- Guidance session with the teacher
- Create the cart “box” which will display on the event and facility page later.#145 https://github.com/Cajolina/sorbygden-booking-app/issues/145
- Create a function to show prices and calculate the total cost.#64 https://github.com/Cajolina/sorbygden-booking-app/issues/64

- Include a remove button and buttons to increase or decrease the quantity, with real-time calculation of the total price.#81 https://github.com/Cajolina/sorbygden-booking-app/issues/81

## What I Will Do Today:

- Provide a button that leads to checkout with Stripe for payment.#82
- Add tasks to disable button functionality when an item is out of stock or unavailable.
- Build the basic structure for the event page.#74
- Basic structure for the facilities page.#53
- start with login client side
