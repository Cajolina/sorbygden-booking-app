- If an event is sold out, indicate it through text, and the booking button should be disabled.
  #77

Display an error message if the event is sold out (either in the cart or out of stock) and if the facility is currently unavailable.

Time:30min estimate: 2h

## Created issue:

- Fix bug: Disable the button when the event is out of stock.
  #204

When I click on an event and add it to the cart, it disables the button on other events if they don't have the same stock quantity.
Refactored code for better accuracy: When clicking on an event to add it to the cart, the button is disabled for other events based on their individual stock quantities. Added a more efficient cart item lookup using find, and adjusted disable button conditions for better accuracy.

Time: 55min estimate: 5h
