## What I Accomplished Yesterday:

  Time: 3h estimate:8h
- Research OAuth. https://github.com/Cajolina/sorbygden-booking-app/issues/50

  Time: 3h 50min, Total time 4h + 3h 50min, Estimate: 16h

## What I Will Do Today:

- Establish endpoints for logging in and logging out.
- Create an admin user in MongoDB Atlas.
- Set up a Stripe account.
- Insert products and variants into the database and Stripe
