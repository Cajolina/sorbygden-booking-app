## What I Accomplished Yesterday:
I completed all the tasks and quickly created a new wireframe for my new idea with 'product pages' to better understand and visualize the flow. 
There was no meeting with the classmate about OAuth.
## What I Will Do Today:
Review tasks again and see if it still feels good. Have a meeting at 1 PM with a classmate to bounce ideas about OAuth since we both feel completely lost. 
Start up the project a bit lightly.
## Problems:
Uncertainty about what is expected of me and if it must include certain classic e-commerce aspects.
## Research:
OAuth
## Realizations:
Planning takes a long time.
## Other:
