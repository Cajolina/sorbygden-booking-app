### Daily Documentation - [2023-12-30]

## What I Accomplished Yesterday:
Reviewed tasks again. Had a meeting at 1 PM with 2 classmates to bounce ideas about OAuth since we all feel completely lost. Started up the project and read about the connection between Stripe and MongoDB Atlas. Created a test project and test database and a Stripe project to be able to experiment and find a good solution.
## What I Will Do Today:
Get a better structure for the entire project. I feel cluttered and stressed, and my goal is to successfully establish a good structure and overview of the project, as well as reduce stress. Work on the task https://github.com/Cajolina/sorbygden-booking-app/issues/41 
## Problems:
Feeling uncertain about the workflow, such as whether to document time here or in issues, and whether each specific issue should have time estimates and where to record the actual time spent. Should one use story points or is it acceptable to use hours when estimating time? 

We didn't gain clarity after the meeting and the OAuth research, we couldn't grasp how to implement it. It occurred to me that it will take a significant amount of time to understand it, and it might not be suitable for this project with time constraints.
## Research:
MongoDB and Stripe Connection: 6 hours
OAuth Implementation: 4 hours
## Realizations:
I initially thought there would be a straightforward way to connect Stripe and MongoDB, but it required the use of a webhook and HTTPS. This shifted my mindset, and I attempted to address the issue differently. I decided that the admin adds products in the admin panel, the data is sent to both Stripe and MongoDB Atlas. So, when the admin creates a product, a function is triggered to create the product and add it to both Stripe and MongoDB.
