### Daily Documentation - [2024-01-18]

## What I Accomplished Yesterday:

- Create a model for orders and implement functionality to save orders in the database when the payment is verified.#160 https://github.com/Cajolina/sorbygden-booking-app/issues/160

  Time before: 11t 33min Time today: 6h estimate: 4h

- Create an endpoint to fetch orders.#161 https://github.com/Cajolina/sorbygden-booking-app/issues/161
  Time: 45min estimate: 1h
  Create a function on the client side to retrieve all orders, enabling the retrieval of all information based on the product ID.#173 https://github.com/Cajolina/sorbygden-booking-app/issues/173

  Time:3h 8 min estimate: 5h

## What I Will Do Today:

- Address the issue so that products can be added from both the event and facility models, as the current solution only pertains to events.#174
- Research and plan how to implement booking functionality for facilities.#179 To be prepared for a meeting with the teacher.
- Guidance session with the teacher
- Build a basic structure for the admin panel.#103
- Build endpoints on the backend to fetch all facilities and events, functionality to add, modify, delete, and add products â€“ CRUD.#105
- Test to insert some facilities and events into the database from admin panel.#133
- Add task for 'authorize' only listens on 'admin/authorize' when I log in and log out, as well as on '/login' and '/adminpanel', so that it doesn't run all the time.
