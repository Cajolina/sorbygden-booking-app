### Daily Documentation - [2024-01-03]

## What I Accomplished Yesterday:

- Establish endpoints for logging in and logging out. https://github.com/Cajolina/sorbygden-booking-app/issues/102

  Time: 36min estimate: 4h 56min

- Create an admin user in MongoDB Atlas. https://github.com/Cajolina/sorbygden-booking-app/issues/51

  Time: 2.5min, estimate 0.5h

- Set up a Stripe account. https://github.com/Cajolina/sorbygden-booking-app/issues/86

  Time: 4min estimate : 0.5h

I created a new task that involves implementing stricter functionality for product and category creation, update, and deletion, limiting these actions to logged in admin users only.

- Restrict product and category creation, update, and deletion to admin users only. https://github.com/Cajolina/sorbygden-booking-app/issues/119

  Time: 36min estimate: 4h

- Create content for products and event posters. https://github.com/Cajolina/sorbygden-booking-app/issues/124

  Time: 2h 50min - Creating posters
  Total 1h 50min + 2h 50min - 4h 40min
  Estimate: 6h

## What I Will Do Today:

- Research the connection between Stripe and MongoDB Atlas.
- Functionality for product and categories endpoints to create, update, and delete in Stripe as well.
- Basic frontend setup: Create essential folders and files.
- Create essential pages such as the homepage, booking page, login, facility page, eventpage and admin panel, as well as routes.

## Problems:

I got stuck with the login for a while because I added schedule validation to the login, which shouldn't be there.

## Research:

Stripe and also Stripe and MongoDb connection.

## Realizations:

As it took a significant amount of time to grasp the concepts of OAuth, and despite investing many hours, I didn't make substantial progress. Given the time constraints of the project and the realization that I was not advancing, yersterday I made the decision to revert to the techniques we've learned in school instead of using OAuth. However, OAuth is something I'm keen on exploring and understanding, so it will be a topic I delve into during my free time when I'm not under time pressure. The same applies to JWT, which also seems like a valuable concept to learn.
