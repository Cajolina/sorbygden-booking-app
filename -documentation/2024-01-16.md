### Daily Documentation - [2024-01-16]

## What I Accomplished Yesterday:

- Create a model for orders and implement functionality to save orders in the database when the payment is verified.#160 Worked on it all day but didnÂ´t solve the problem.
  Have tried to solve issues with creating an order in the database, including the right items and proper formatting, but got stuck and haven't been able to resolve it.

  Time: 8h 48min

- Replan the sprint, attempt to resolve the order issue, and move forward so that I can catch up on everything else

## What I Will Do Today:

- Create a model for orders and implement functionality to save orders in the database when the payment is verified.#160

- Build a basic structure for the login page.#100
  Implementing server endpoints for authentication checks. Managing admin user authentication state through context, creating content in components for login and admin panel.

## Problems:

I don't know how to proceed with saving orders, so I hope to get some guidance on Thursday from the teacher.

## Research:

Svae orders into db with Stripe checkout

## Realizations:

I need to temporarily set aside certain tasks to make progress with the project.
