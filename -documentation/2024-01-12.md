### Daily Documentation - [2024-01-12]

## What I Accomplished Yesterday:

- Provide a button that leads to checkout with Stripe for payment.#82 https://github.com/Cajolina/sorbygden-booking-app/issues/82

  Time:57min estimate: 3h

  Only created the button and a function in a checkout context where it currently only console logs, before I've implemented the server-side part.
  I create a new issues for the server-side part and another one for the client.

- Check if I should use any design system and component library in the project. #146 https://github.com/Cajolina/sorbygden-booking-app/issues/146

  Time: 34min estimate: 2h

- Add tasks to disable button functionality when an item is out of stock or unavailable.

  Added some more specific tasks:

- You should only be able to see the plus and minus icons on the event cart.#150 https://github.com/Cajolina/sorbygden-booking-app/issues/150

  Time: 38min Estimate 0,5h

- Ensure that it is not possible to increase the quantity of the product in the cart beyond what is in stock and available, and not decrease it below 1.#149 https://github.com/Cajolina/sorbygden-booking-app/issues/149

  Time: 2h 30min estimate: 2h

- Install and see what I can implement in the design/component system right now, and plan what else I will use it for#151 https://github.com/Cajolina/sorbygden-booking-app/issues/151

  Time: 1h 38minestimate: 2h

## What I Will Do Today:

- Conduct research on the connection between the database and Stripe.#87
- Create endpoints for Stripe payment.#89
- Client side: Implement checkout functionality, including initiating the payment process and verifying payment status.#155

## Problems:

## Research:

connection between the database and Stripe.

## Realizations:

I did not start with client-side login. I made some adjustments to my sprint as I realized it resulted in a better workflow. I began with the cart and aimed to complete it before tackling the rest, so I switched some tasks between Sprint 2 and 3.
