# Sörbygden booking app

## About
**Introduction:**  
A website for a local heritage association that simplifies the booking process for their premises, cabins, tables at Christmas markets or flea markets, as well as booking tickets for events or scheduling events. At the same time, the website aims to increase its outreach to reach more people.

**Description of the problem:**  
Sörbygden's local heritage association, the ones I had in mind for this idea, does not have a website, and there isn't really a place, aside from Facebook, where they can advertise or where you can find information about events in Sörbygden, as well as spaces, cabins, and other facilities available for booking. The current system relies on manual Facebook posts for bookings and sometimes requires physical meetings for payment. This process is both time-consuming and limited to users on the social media platform.

**Solution:**  
The purpose of the website is to create a platform that simplifies the entire booking process, allowing users to easily reserve spaces, cottages, tables, and event tickets, as well as book their own events. By enabling users to book and complete the entire purchase flow on the website, it eliminates the need for physical transactions and opens up opportunities for enhanced marketing.
